            possible at virtually any age, but the strategies, savings rates,
            and challenges vary dramatically depending on when you want to

            The younger your target retirement age, the more aggressive your
            approach needs to be. While retiring at 55 might require saving
            25-35% of your income, retiring at 35 could demand 60-70% savings
            rates and significant lifestyle adjustments. Let's explore what's

                How much do I need to retire at 40?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                To retire at 40, you typically need 25-30x your annual expenses
                saved. For $50,000/year in expenses, that's $1.25-1.5 million.
                The higher multiplier accounts for a longer retirement period.
                Starting at 25, you'd need to save about $3,000-4,000/month
                assuming 7% returns.

              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Yes, you can retire at 50 with $1 million if your annual
                expenses are $40,000 or less (using the 4% rule). For a more
                conservative 3.5% withdrawal rate, you'd need expenses under
                $35,000/year. Consider that you'll have 15 years before Medicare
                eligibility, so factor in health insurance costs.

              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The "best" age depends on your personal circumstances, but many
                FIRE achievers target 40-50. This balances having enough working
                years to accumulate wealth with plenty of healthy retirement
                years. Earlier retirement requires more aggressive saving and
                potentially lower withdrawal rates.

              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Younger retirees should use lower withdrawal rates. While the 4%
                rule works for 30-year retirements, consider:

                  <li>Age 30-35: 3-3.25% withdrawal rate</li>

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Retiring at 35 is challenging but achievable with the right
                circumstances: high income ($100k+), low expenses, 60-70%
                savings rate, and disciplined investing. Most who achieve this
                work in high-paying fields, live frugally, and often have no
                children or delay having them. Geographic arbitrage to low-cost
                areas helps significantly.

              <AccordionContent className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Retiring early with children adds complexity but is doable. Key
                considerations: Budget $10-15k per child annually, plan for
                college (529 plans), factor in larger housing needs, and
                consider part-time work for stability. Many FIRE families find
                that having more time with kids is worth the extra financial
                planning required.
