## 🎯 Goal & Vision

### **Goal**
To build the most comprehensive, user-friendly, and transparent open-source financial independence calculator on the web.

Democratize financial planning by providing professional-grade simulation tools in an accessible, privacy-focused, and beautiful interface. We believe everyone should have the ability to model their financial future without needing a finance degree or expensive software.

### **Business Model**
InvestingFIRE operates on a transparent open-source model:
1.  **Free Forever Core:** The essential calculation tools will always be free and open-source.
2.  **Community Supported:** We rely on community contributions (code & feedback) to improve the tool.
3.  **Educational Affiliates:** We may curate high-quality resources (books, courses, tools) to help users on their journey, keeping the tool free of intrusive ads.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are actively expanding the capabilities of InvestingFIRE. Below is our plan broken down into phases.

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Simulation (The Engine)**
Focus on making the math more robust and flexible.
- [ ] **Coast FIRE Mode:** Option to stop contributions at a certain age but retire later.
- [ ] **Barista FIRE Mode:** Include part-time income during "retirement" years.
- [ ] **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Add probabilistic outcomes (e.g., "95% chance of success") instead of just deterministic linear growth.
- [ ] **Variable Withdrawal Strategies:** Implement dynamic withdrawal rules (e.g., Guyton-Klinger) beyond just fixed inflation-adjusted withdrawals.

### **Phase 2: User Experience & Persistence**
Make the tool easier to use and return to.
- [ ] **URL State Sharing:** Encode form values into the URL so scenarios can be bookmarked and shared.
- [ ] **Local Persistence:** Automatically save user inputs to `localStorage` so they don't vanish on refresh.
- [ ] **Currency & Locale Support:** Allow users to select currency symbols and number formatting (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.).

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Analytics**
For the power users who need more detail.
- [ ] **Tax Considerations:** Simple toggles for Pre-tax vs. Post-tax estimations.
- [ ] **Scenario Comparison:** Compare two different plans side-by-side (e.g., "Retire at 45 vs 55").
- [ ] **Data Export:** Download projection data as CSV or PDF reports.

### **Phase 4: Content & Community**
- [ ] **Blog/Guides:** Integrate a CMS (like Markdown/MDX) for in-depth financial guides.
- [ ] **Community Presets:** "One-click" setups for common strategies (e.g., "Lean FIRE", "Fat FIRE").

## 🧰 How It Works

The calculator models your FIRE journey in two phases:

1. **Accumulation:**
   - Your starting capital is grown by your expected CAGR (~7% by default).
   - Monthly savings are added for each year until retirement.
   - Every variable can be adjusted live (capital, savings, age, growth, inflation, spending, target retirement).

2. **Retirement:**
   - Your balance continues to grow by CAGR.
   - Each year, an inflation-adjusted monthly allowance is withdrawn.
   - The simulation runs until your selected life expectancy, showing the possibility of portfolio depletion.

**Key Outputs:**

- 🔥 “FIRE Number”: Portfolio value at your defined retirement age
- 📊 Interactive projection chart: See how your nest egg and withdrawals evolve over time
- 4️⃣ “4% Rule” overlays: Compare dynamic results to classic rule-of-thumb
